Checking for data in the dslabs package:
```{r}
library(dslabs)
data(package = "dslabs")

```
I haven't found the Moneyball data here...

```{r}
library(Lahman)
library(tidyverse)
ds_theme_set()
head(Teams)
```
Here it is!!
And now I will save the table in rda format for the project:
```{r}
save(Teams, file = "rda/teams.rda")
?Teams
```
